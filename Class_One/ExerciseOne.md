# Question One
 - Create a class Calculator that should perform the following actions:
  1. Addition / Subtraction
  2. Multiplication / Division
  3. Take (n) root of number
   4. Reset memory (Calculator must have its own memory, meaning it should manipulate its starting number 0 until it is reset.). This means that for example calculator should perform actions with a value inside its memory (for this example value inside the calculator's memory is 0): calculator.add(2) results in 2.
- Create test for the actions
