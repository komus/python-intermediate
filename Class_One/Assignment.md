# Assignment

## Question 1
Write a program that computes the prime number from 1 to N.

A prime number is a number only divisible by 1 and itself

## Question Two
compute the cube sum of first n natural numbers
``` python
Input : n = 5
Output : 225
13 + 23 + 33 + 43 + 53 = 225
```

## Question Three
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1: 
``` python
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [0,1]
    Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

Example 2: 
``` python
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
    Output: [1,2]
```

Example 3: 
``` python
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
    Output: [0,1]
```

## Question 4
Constructor accept a string `_init_`

Methods
- Get length of string
- Reverse the string
- if length > 5: get the first three characters
- if length > 6: get the last 4 characters
- Accept int for a user that is less than length of the string and return the character in position [int]

Test
- Write test for all your methods
