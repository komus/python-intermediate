# Assignment

## Question 1
Write a program that computes the prime number from 1 to N.

A prime number is a number only divisible by 1 and itself

``` python
Input : n = 10
Output : [1,2,3,5,7]
```

## Question Two
compute the cube sum of first n natural numbers
``` python
Input : n = 5
Output : 225
1*1*1 + 2*2*2 + 3*3*3 + 4*4*4 + 5*5*5 = 225
```

## Question Three
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1: 
``` python
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [0,1]
    Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

Example 2: 
``` python
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
    Output: [1,2]
```

Example 3: 
``` python
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
    Output: [0,1]
```

## Question 4
Create a class for string operation. The class Constructor accepts a string 

Methods
- Get length of string
- Reverse the string
- if length > 5: get the first three characters
- if length > 6: get the last 4 characters
- returns character in a position. This method accepts int. if the inputted int is less than the length of the string,  return the character in position [int], else return error

Test
- Write test for all your methods
