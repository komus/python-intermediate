# OOP - object oriented programming

A class is a blueprint, an object is an instance of a class.
An object has attributes/characteristics and methods/behavior

- Abstraction - Used as features for other classes. It is meant to inherited from but not instantiated. Narrowing down to the essential features that are critical to an object. It is a generalization class
- encapsulation - hiding access to private details of an object
- polymorphism - the ability to use the same interface for objects of different types
- Inheritance - Extending another class. Single inheritance, multiple inheritance
